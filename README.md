node liri.js do-what-it-says
<br>

Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

It should run spotify-this-song for "Technicolour Beat" as follows the text in random.txt.

Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.
